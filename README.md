# Hilbert Tree

This art is based on a minumum spanning tree,
where vertices are the pixels and edges are horizontal and vertical adjacency,
and edge weights are uniformly random.

The minimum spanning tree is explored in depth-first order, starting at a random vertex,
and vertices are assigned colors in Hilbert curve order.
